# Dynamic-NFT
## Using Revise
### Revise is a platform that helps us in developing dynamic NFTs. Dynamic NFTs are NFTs that don't just sit in wallet. They evolve over time. If it is a gaming NFT, it will evolve based on the performance in the game. You get the gist. The properties, image (or other media), name, and description of the NFT will change. In some cases, certain trait values being tracked on-chain will change as well. Revise let us connect the NFTs you build to the real-world data, events, and triggers and let us program the NFT the way you see fit.
